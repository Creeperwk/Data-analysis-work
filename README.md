## Using Pandas, Matplotlib, Scipy, Numpy, Sklearn to analysis, train and visualise data

## Task 1 Whiskey data
-- Use Matplotlib to plot the latitude (x‐axis) against the longitude (y‐axis) for all the different whisky locations.
-- Update the plot that different colours represents different region of whisky.
-- Create the Pie Chart for the frequency of each region of whisky.

## Task 2 Random data t-test and Kernel density plots
-- Create three variables with 1000 samples each and normally distributed with mean 1,3,3 respectively. Fit them into a dataframe.
-- Two sample t-test between each pair of variables
-- Kernel density plots with each density rate estimate for each variable.

## Task 3 Breast cancer data
-- Get the means and standard deviations for each covariate, use ‘StandardScalar’ to scale X
-- Split the data into training and test datasets, where test set will represent 20% of the dataset.
-- Fit a logistic model on the scaled training data and make separate predictions on both the scaled training and test data.
-- Calculate the accuracy and F1 scores on both the scaled training and scaled test datasets.
-- Using ‘GenericUnivariateSelect’ create an updated model which retains 50% of the ’best’ covariates. Visualise it with a bar plot.
